# URL Parsing
  Write a python script that has a function called urlparser.

##           def urlparser(url):

This function will accept a URL from the list of two URLS and parse it into its constituent
parts.

You may use a dictionary to store the parsed portions of the url.
You are **not allowed to use any specific libraries that help in url parsing.**

For testing the robustness of your code, you may use any valid arbitrary URL.


# TCP Client Server


In URL Parsing, you found out how to parse a given URL ans store the different parts in a dictionary.

For this question you have the following tasks: 
  1. Write a simple **TCP Client** that sends the different parts of the given URL in a
     JSON package. 
  2. Write a simple **TCP Server** that receives the message from the TCP Client and 
     assemble the parts of the URL to print the entire valid URL.
