# Introduction to Python Programming

You are provided with the dataset generated by an imperfect crawler that downloaded the WEST webpage for two levels of hirearchy. It consists of :

   1. The order of the links accessed
   2. The crawled URLS
   3. The amount of time in seconds to extract further URLs from that URL
   4. The hierarchy of the link

Write a simple python script that does the following

  1. Read the dataset from dataset. cav file as a pandas dataframe, 
  2. Plot the time distribution.
  3. Remove the last 20% from your dataset.
  4. Plot the time distribution again
  5. Remove all the entries that has "o" in the time_in_seconds column.
  6. Plot the time distribution again.

NOTE: For this question, you need to use pandas and you may use matplotlib only. No other library usage is permisible.
